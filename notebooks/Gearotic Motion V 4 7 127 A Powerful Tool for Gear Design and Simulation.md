# Gearotic Motion V 4 7 127: A Powerful Tool for Gear Design and Simulation
 
Gearotic Motion is a software program that allows users to create and simulate various types of gears, pulleys and mechanisms. It can also generate toolpaths for accurate gears, pulleys and sprockets, as well as STL files for 3D printing and 3D solids for CAD applications. Gearotic Motion can create most of the existing gear types found today, such as spur gears, lantern and pinion, non-circular gears, imaginary gears and bevels. Bevel gears can be output in straight, helix or zerol formats, plus escapements for clock building. Spur gears may use helical outputs and all of the created 2D gear types can then be exported into DXF files or 1:1 scale printouts.

Gearotic Motion also has a 3D graphic simulation that allows users to visualize how their devices work and to determine other factors they may want to consider. It provides statistics about gear ratios, sizes, centering and such, and is a fun and easy to use program with a drag and drop interface for mechanism creation. Gearotic Motion is designed for hobbyists who want to make gears easily, whether they are making clocks, window openers, whirly gigs or Rube-Goldberg machines. It also has a forum where users can share their ideas or results with other enthusiasts.
 
Gearotic Motion V 4 7 127 is the latest version of the program, released in March 2022. It has some new features and improvements, such as:
 
- A new vector CAD program that allows users to draw shapes and curves in 2D or 3D.
- A new 3D modeler for printing of nuts and bolts.
- A new module for creating elliptical gears of any order.
- A new module for creating functional polar coordinate gears.
- An improved interface with more options and customization.
- A certificate verification tool for licensed users.

Gearotic Motion V 4 7 127 is available for download on the official website at [https://www.gearotic.com/](https://www.gearotic.com/). Users can also find more information, tutorials and support on the website or on the forum at [http://gearotic.com/ESW/FavIcons/index.php](http://gearotic.com/ESW/FavIcons/index.php). Gearotic Motion is a swiss army knife of CAD tools that can help users unleash their creativity and design their own gears and mechanisms.
  
One of the most popular features of Gearotic Motion is the ability to create non-circular gears, such as elliptical, oval, heart-shaped or even imaginary gears. These gears can have interesting and unusual motions and applications, such as variable speed drives, pumps, clocks or art pieces. Gearotic Motion allows users to define the shape and size of their non-circular gears, as well as the number of teeth, the pitch and the pressure angle. Users can also adjust the eccentricity and phase of their gears to achieve different effects. Gearotic Motion can simulate the motion of non-circular gears and show how they mesh with each other or with circular gears. Users can also export their non-circular gears into various formats for further use.
 
Another feature that sets Gearotic Motion apart from other gear design programs is the ability to create bevel gears. Bevel gears are gears that have conical teeth and are used to transmit motion between shafts that are not parallel. Bevel gears are commonly found in automobiles, bicycles, helicopters and other machines. Gearotic Motion can create three types of bevel gears: straight, helical and zerol. Straight bevel gears have straight teeth that are aligned with the axis of the gear. Helical bevel gears have teeth that are curved and angled with respect to the axis of the gear. Zerol bevel gears are a special type of helical bevel gears that have zero spiral angle. Gearotic Motion can calculate the dimensions and parameters of bevel gears based on the desired gear ratio, shaft angle and module. Users can also modify the tooth profile, width and clearance of their bevel gears. Gearotic Motion can generate toolpaths for 4th axis CNC machining or STL files for 3D printing of bevel gears.
 
Gearotic Motion is not only a program for creating gears, but also a program for creating mechanisms. Users can combine different types of gears, pulleys, belts, chains, sprockets, levers, springs and other components to create complex and functional devices. Users can drag and drop components from the library or create their own custom components. Users can also link components together with joints or constraints to define their motion and interaction. Gearotic Motion can simulate the motion of mechanisms and show how they work in real time. Users can also measure the speed, torque, power and efficiency of their mechanisms. Gearotic Motion can help users design and test their own inventions or recreate existing machines.
